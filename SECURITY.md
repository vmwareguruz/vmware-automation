# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

Do **NOT** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email the repository maintainer directly:
📧 <your-email@example.com>

Please include:
- Detailed description  
- Vulnerable script or function  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Suggested fix (if known)

## Supported Versions

Only scripts in the `main` branch are actively reviewed for security fixes.
